# Covid-patient-checker-Project
This C program collects a patient's personal details and checks for four symptoms: cold, fever, throat pain, and body pain. If all symptoms are present, the patient is marked as COVID positive and advised hospital admission. If only some symptoms are present, the result is COVID negative.
